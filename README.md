# About Me
This is the digital resume for Kevin Cox, owner of TEK Vector

## As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.

To solve this, there is a top 10 list at the bottom of my resume, which share some of my favorite development ideas, tools, and technologies

## As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.

To implement this, I integrated a series of prompts via javascript to help answer questions the visitor may have without having to read through my resume

Adding on to the previous prompt series, I added a random number game (If the user wants to actually play) via prompts that allows the users to have fun while seeing what I can do with code.

## As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.

Helping drive with the theme, I also prompt them to ask me what branch of the armed forces I was in.
