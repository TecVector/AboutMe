            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a Senior Software Engineer with a primary focus on the .NET Development Framework with C#. I've been professionally developing for 10 years, and have had exposure to many different cultures and programming environments.</p>
            <p>Outside of full time development, I also work as a TA for DeltaV Code School helping develop other's skills within the programming world. I've started doing this as I work towards my Microsoft Certified Trainer (MTT) so I can continue to grow
                within my career.</p>
            <p>When not working with technology, I spend time with my wife and our 5 kids. We're a big gaming family (Board Games), and are always looking for new games to try out. It's always an interesting experience, because we have such different interests
                when it comes to board games.</p>
